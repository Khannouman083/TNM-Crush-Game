# TNM-Crush-Game-SFML
 The "TNM Crush" game is a match-three puzzle game implemented in C++ using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The game involves swapping adjacent gems to create matches of three or more identical gems, which then disappear, and new gems fall from above to fill the gaps. The main goal is to score points by creating matches and clearing the board.
